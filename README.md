# MTG Fetcher

MTG Fetcher is a FireMonkey-based Delphi application designed to streamline Magic: The Gathering (MTG) card browsing and information retrieval using the Scryfall API. It provides a user-friendly interface for searching, viewing, and filtering card details, such as card images, legalities, prices, and more.

It leverages Delphiâ€™s powerful FireMonkey (FMX) framework to create a cross-platform application with support for Windows and Android. It needs A lot of work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The application retrieves MTG card data directly from Scryfall, enabling advanced features such as:
- Card image viewing (including support for double-faced cards).
- Filtering cards by set, rarity, color, and other attributes.
- Displaying card legalities, power/toughness, mana cost, and prices.
- A visually rich, responsive UI.
